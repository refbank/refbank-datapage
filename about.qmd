## palmerpenguins

The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to `iris`.

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). The dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

Data are available by [CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) license in accordance with the [Palmer Station LTER Data Policy](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/data/) and the [LTER Data Access Policy for Type I data](https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/).
